## OpenThread Command Line Example on ESP32  
  
<img src="/Images/OTBR-ESP32-CLI.png" height="200"> 

This example demonstrates how to use [OpenThread](https://openthread.io/), an open-source implementation of the Thread networking protocol, on Espressif SoCs through ESP-IDF. Thread is a low-power, IPv6-based mesh networking protocol designed for connected devices in smart homes and IoT applications. It provides reliable communication, self-healing mesh capabilities, and secure commissioning, making it an important foundation for modern connected ecosystems, including Matter (formerly CHIP).  

The `ot_cli` example exposes the full OpenThread command-line interface (CLI) over a serial console. Developers can interact with the Thread stack directly, issue commands to create or join a Thread network, configure devices as routers or end devices, and test connectivity between nodes. By using this example, you can gain hands-on experience with how Thread devices form a network, route messages, and communicate securely.  

Beyond basic networking commands, the CLI can be extended to experiment with application-layer communication, such as sending UDP/TCP messages between nodes, integrating with higher-level protocols, or even bridging Thread with Wi-Fi or Ethernet via an OpenThread Border Router (OTBR). This makes the `ot_cli` example a flexible starting point for exploring both Thread fundamentals and advanced use cases on ESP platforms.  

  
### Prerequisites 🧰
  
To run this OT-CLI example on ESP32 boards, there are following Hardware-software Prerequisites - 
  
### Hardware
- To run this example, a board with IEEE 802.15.4 module (for example ESP32-H2)/ESP32-C6 is required.
- We used ESP32-H2-DevKitM-1
